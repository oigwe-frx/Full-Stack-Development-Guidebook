    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>This is my first web page.</p>

#### HTML Markup

> - The ML in HTML stands for "markup language". Markup refers to a way of annotating text that is distinguishable from the text itself.
> - HTML separates content and annotation by using HTML tags, which are denoted by angle brackets (also known as less than ("<") and greater than signs (">")).

> - Tags annotations provide information about the type of content they contain.
> - ___HTML element:___ a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains.
    > - ___Opening Tag:___ the element name used to start an HTML element. The tag type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets.
    > - ___Content:___  The information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.
    > - ___Closing tag:___  the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element. Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.

#### HTML Hypertext
> - Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.
> - Hypertext is text which contains links to other texts. The term was coined by Ted Nelson around 1965.
> - HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext that is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video, and sound.
> - Supposedly, Ted Nelson was the first to use this term.
> - Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.
> - Many modern websites provide rich user experiences, with features like embedded videos, animations, and interactivity, so it doesnâ€™t necessarily feel like you are just navigating from one HTML page to the next.
    - But despite all of the advances that have taken place with the growth of the web, at its core the web is still just a collection of hyperlinked documents.
