#### HTML Markup

> - The ML in HTML stands for "markup language". Markup refers to a way of annotating text that is distinguishable from the text itself.
> - HTML separates content and annotation by using HTML tags, which are denoted by angle brackets (also known as less than ("<") and greater than signs (">")).

    > HTML element — a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains.
    > Opening Tag — the element name used to start an HTML element. The tag type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets.
    > Content — The information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.
