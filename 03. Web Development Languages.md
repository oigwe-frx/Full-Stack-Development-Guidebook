### HTML

> - It provides structure to the content on a website, including text, images, buttons, videos, and more.
> - HTML stands for ___hypertext markup language___. 
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My web page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>This is my first web page.</p>
        <p>It contains a

#### HTML Markup

> - The ML in HTML stands for "markup language". Markup refers to a way of annotating text that is distinguishable from the text itself.
> - HTML separates content and annotation by using HTML tags, which are denoted by angle brackets (also known as less than ("<") and greater than signs (">")).

> - Tags annotations provide information about the type of content they contain.
> - ___HTML element:___ a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains.
> - ___Opening Tag:___ the element name used to start an HTML element. The tag type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets.
> - ___Content:___  The information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.

##### Markup vs Markdown
> - What is the difference between markup and Markdown?
> -  ___Markup___ is a notation that is used to annotate text in a document to provide details on the text's structure or instructions for how it should be displayed.
> -  ___Markdown___ is a plain text formatting syntax that converts the plain text formatting to HTML."Jul 14, 2023


#### HTML Hypertext
> - Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.
> - Hypertext is text which contains links to other texts. The term was coined by Ted Nelson around 1965.
> - HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext that is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video, and sound.
> - Supposedly, Ted Nelson was the first to use this term.
> - Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.
> - Many modern websites provide rich user experiences, with features like embedded videos, animations, and interactivity, so it doesn’t necessarily feel like you are just navigating from one HTML page to the next.
    - But despite all of the advances that have taken place with the growth of the web, at its core the web is still just a collection of hyperlinked documents.


## CSS

> - CSS is the language that provides style to the content of an HTML page. This includes colors, fonts, positioning, layout, and more!
> - Keeping the CSS separate from the HTML is a comp-sci principle separation of concerns.
> - Large codebases are kept maintainable when each section has clearly differentiated problems that it is trying to solve.
> - Since the styling rules are described separately from the content itself when new content is added, this content will automatically take on the styling of the new content

## Javascript

> Any website that provides more than just static information probably utilizes JavaScript in some way. Here are some familiar examples of website features most often built with JavaScript:
> - popup ads
> - animated graphics (2D or 3D)
> - interactive audio and video
> - maps and other features access the user’s geographic location

> One of the defining features of JavaScript is its ability to respond to browser events. These events happen in real time and can be triggered by a wide variety of user interactions, including:
> - the user clicking on a button
> - the user pressing enter on their keyboard
> - video file finishing loading
> - the user re-sizing their window
> - the user hovering over text on the webpage

## SQL

> - SQL, stands for structured query language.
> - SQL stores information in tables, which is simply a collection of information organized into rows and columns (think Excel/Google Sheets).
> - To get the information, you would write a query or a program that would retrieve data from the table.
``` SELECT * FROM users; ```
