## What is the Command Line?

> - The command line is a text interface for the computer’s operating system.
> - It’s a program that takes in commands and passes them on to the computer’s operating system to run.
> - You can use it to traverse and edit your computer’s filesystem.
> - Through the command line, you can create new files, edit the contents of those files, delete files, and more!
> - On Mac and Linux systems, we access the command line through something called Bash. In this course, we will focus on Bash.
> - Although Windows comes with a different built-in command line, Windows users can also download Bash.


## Filesystems

> - A filesystem organizes a computer’s files and directories into a tree structure:
>   - The first directory in the filesystem is the root directory. It is the parent of all other directories and files in the filesystem.
>   - Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files. In the filesystem on the right, blog/ is the parent of 2014/, 2015/, and hardware.txt.
>   - Each directory can contain more files and child directories. The parent-child relationship continues as long as directories and files are nested.
