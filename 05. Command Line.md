## What is the Command Line?

- The command line is a text interface for the computer’s operating system.
- It’s a program that takes in commands and passes them on to the computer’s operating system to run.
- You can use it to traverse and edit your computer’s filesystem.
- Through the command line, you can create new files, edit the contents of those files, delete files, and more!
- On Mac and Linux systems, we access the command line through something called Bash. In this course, we will focus on Bash.
- Although Windows comes with a different built-in command line, Windows users can also download Bash.
