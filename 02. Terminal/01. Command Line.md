## What is the Command Line?

> - The command line is a text interface for the computer’s operating system.
> - It’s a program that takes in commands and passes them on to the computer’s operating system to run.
> - You can use it to traverse and edit your computer’s filesystem.
> - Through the command line, you can create new files, edit the contents of those files, delete files, and more!
> - On Mac and Linux systems, we access the command line through something called Bash. In this course, we will focus on Bash.
> - Although Windows comes with a different built-in command line, Windows users can also download Bash.


## Filesystems

> - A filesystem organizes a computer’s files and directories into a tree structure:
>   - The first directory in the filesystem is the root directory. It is the parent of all other directories and files in the filesystem.
>   - Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files. 
>   - Each directory can contain more files and child directories. The parent-child relationship continues as long as directories and files are nested.

## Shell Prompt

> - In the terminal, the first thing you see is ```$```.
> - This is called a shell prompt. It appears when the terminal is ready to accept a command.

### Navigation Commands (that are typed into the terminal)

| Command | Meaning | Definition | Example |
|---------|---------|------------| ------------|
| pwd | Print Working Directory | The shell command pwd displays the file path from the root directory to the current working directory. | Input ``` $ pwd ``` <br/> Output ```/Users/johnDoe/Desktop``` |
| ls | List | The shell command ls is used to list the contents of a directory. If no arguments are given, it will list the contents of the current working directory. All files and folders | Input: ```$ ls Desktop```  <br/> Output: ```job_application.pdf``` |
| mkdir | Make Directory (A folder) | The shell command mkdir is used to make a new directory in the filesystem according to its argument. If a file path is given, the new directory will be placed at the end. Otherwise, it will create a new directory in the current working directory. | Inout: ```$ mkdir new-directory``` <br/>  Output: ```$ ls       old-directory    new-directory ```|
| touch | Create A New File | The shell command touch creates a new file in the current working directory with the name provided. | Input: ```$ touch grocery-list.txt``` |
| cd | Change Directories | The shell command cd is used to move throughout the filesystem of a computer. This is the terminal version of clicking on a folder to open it. cd accepts a variety of arguments: Full file paths, Names of children of the current directory, .. the parent of the current directory. | Input: ```$ cd some-directory``` or ```$ cd .. ```| 
| clear | Clear the Terminal | The commands that you previously typed are removed from the terminal view | |


### Viewing and Changing the File System (that are typed into the terminal)

| Command | Meaning | Definition | Example    |
|---------|---------|------------|------------|
| cp | copy | The shell command cp is used to copy files or directories. The basic argument structure is cp source destination, where the source is the file/directory to copy to the destination file/directory.| Input ``` $ cp file1 file1_copy ```|
| mv | Move | The shell command mv is used to move a file into a directory. Use mv with the source file as the first argument and the destination directory as the second argument. | Input: ``` $ mv index.html website/```|
| rm | remove | BE CAREDFUL: The shell command rm is used to delete files and directories. | Input : ```$ rm  selfie.png``` |


### Command Options
- Options can be used to modify the behavior of shell commands. Shell command options are commonly represented by a single letter preceded by a -. For example, -l, -a, and -d could all be options that follow a shell command.

| Command + Option | Meaning | Definition | Example    |
|---------|---------|------------|------------|
| rm -r | remove all | BE CAREFUL: rm -r flag deletes a directory and all of its contents | Input ``` $ rm -r bad_selfies``` |
| li -a | list all | lists all contents within the directory, including hidden files and directories. | |
| li -l | list long format| | lists all contents within the directory, in long format | |
| li  -t | list via time | lists all contents within the directory, by the time they were last modified. | |
| cd ..  | Navigate up one (1) directory | The argument .. stands for the directory above the current working directory. Think of it as clicking out of a folder | |

#### Note on cd
- To move across multiple directories with a single command, we can provide cd an absolute or relative path command in order to navigate to the desired directory as an argument.
- The absolute path is a path leading from the file system root all the way down to the desired directory: ```/home/ccuser/workspace/blog/2015/.```
- The relative path is a forward slash (/) separated list of all the directories leading to the goal directory. 
> - Example: ``` $ cd 2015/jan/memory```
>     - Current Directory: /home/ccuser/workspace/blog
>     - command: ``` $ $ cd 2015/jan/memory ```
>     - You will find yourself at directory level: /home/ccuser/workspace/blog/2015/jan/memory
- You can also move up multiple directories using the .. argument. Each pair (..) represent one up
>  - Example: `` $ cd ../../ `` = using one command to move __UP__ the file system by 2 directories/folders
>     - Current Directory: /home/ccuser/workspace/blog/2015/jan/memory
>     - command: ``$ cd ../..`` (move up 2 folders
>     - You will find yourself at directory level:  /home/ccuser/workspace/blog/2015
>
