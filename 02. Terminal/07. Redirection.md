# Redirection

Through redirection, you can direct the input and output of a command to and from other files and programs, and chain commands together in a pipeline.

> 1. __standard input__, abbreviated as stdin, is information inputted into the terminal through the keyboard or input device.
> 2. __standard output__, abbreviated as stdout, is the information outputted after a process is run.
> 3. __standard error__, abbreviated as stderr, is an error message outputted by a failed process.

## >

```$ echo "Hello" > hello.txt```

The > command redirects the standard output to a file. Here, "Hello" is entered as the standard input, and is then redirected to the file hello.txt by > .

> ```$ cat deserts.txt > forests.txt```
> ">" takes the standard output of the command on the left, and redirects it to the file on the right. Here the standard output of cat deserts.txt is redirected to forests.txt.
> NOTE !!!!! -  that > overwrites all original content in forests.txt. When you view the output data by using cat on forests.txt, you will see only the contents of deserts.txt.

## >>

To add to a file without losing the original text, use the >> command!

> ">>" takes the standard output of the command on the left and appends (adds) it to the file on the right.
> >> takes the standard output of the command on the left and appends (adds) it to the file on the right.
