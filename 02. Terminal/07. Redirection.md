# Redirection

Through redirection, you can direct the input and output of a command to and from other files and programs, and chain commands together in a pipeline.

> 1. __standard input__, abbreviated as stdin, is information inputted into the terminal through the keyboard or input device.
> 2. __standard output__, abbreviated as stdout, is the information outputted after a process is run.
> 3. __standard error__, abbreviated as stderr, is an error message outputted by a failed process.


## >

```$ echo "Hello" > hello.txt```

The > command redirects the standard output to a file. 
- "Hello" is entered as the standard input, and is then redirected to the file hello.txt by > .

> ```$ cat deserts.txt > forests.txt```
> - ">" takes the standard output of the command on the left, and redirects it to the file on the right.
> - The standard output of cat deserts.txt is redirected to forests.txt.
> NOTE !!!!! -  that > overwrites all original content in forests.txt. When you view the output data by using cat on forests.txt, you will see only the contents of deserts.txt.


## >>

To add to a file without losing the original text, use the >> command!

> - ">>" takes the standard output of the command on the left and appends (adds) it to the file on the right.
> - ">>" takes the standard output of the command on the left and appends (adds) it to the file on the right.
> - ```$ cat deserts.txt >> forests.txt```
> - The output data of forests.txt will contain the original contents of forests.txt with the content of deserts.txt appended to it.


## <

```$ cat < deserts.txt```
"<" takes the standard input from the file on the right and inputs it into the command on the left.

> Here, deserts.txt is the standard input for the cat command. The standard output appears in the terminal.
> While this above example accomplishes the same thing as cat deserts.txt (without the redirect), it is important to know that input can be redirected.

"|" is a “pipe.” The | takes the standard output of the command on the left, and pipes it as standard input to the command on the right.

> To count the words in volcanoes.txt using the word count command wc: ```$ cat volcanoes.txt | wc```
> Above, the output of cat volcanoes.txt becomes the standard input of wc. In turn, the wc command outputs the number of lines, words, and characters in volcanoes.txt, respectively.

> ```$ cat volcanoes.txt | wc | cat > count.txt```
> Multiple |s can be chained together. Above the standard output of cat volcanoes.txt is “piped” to the wc command. The standard output of wc is then “piped” to cat. Finally, the standard output of cat is redirected to count.txt.


## sort

```$ sort continents.txt```
"sort" takes the standard input and orders it alphabetically for the standard output (it doesn’t change the file itself). In the above, the continents in continents.txt will be listed in alphabetical order:

```
Africa
Antarctica
Asia
Australia
Europe
North America
South America
```

```$ cat glaciers.txt | sort > sorted-glaciers.txt```

> The command takes the standard output from ```cat glaciers.txt``` and “pipes” it to sort.
> The standard output of sort is redirected to a new file named sorted-glaciers.txt.
