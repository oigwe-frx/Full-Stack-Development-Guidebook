## Copying, Moving, and Removing files and directories from the command line

| Command | Meaning | Definition | Example |
|---------|---------|------------| ------------|
| cat |  | The cat command outputs the contents of a specified file. For example, running the following inside the movies/ directory | Input ``` $ cat genres.txt ``` or ``` catmaction/batman.txt ``` <br/> Output ``` output all the text from genres.txt ``` |
| cp |  | Copies files or directories | Input ``` $ cp source.txt destination.txt ``` <br/> Output ```This will make a copy of source.txt and save it as destination.bak.``` |


### Note about cp
> - The destination can be a directory. ```cp the-office.txt slapstick```. >   - The above example will put an exact copy named the-office.txt in the slapstick/ directory.
> - If we wanted to rename the file as well, we would include the name in the path of the second argument:
>   - ```cp the-office.txt comedy/the-office-us.txt```


### Note about bak
 > “.bak“ file extension is commonly used to notate a file as a backup of a file with the same name.
