## Copying, Moving, and Removing files and directories from the command line

| Command | Meaning | Definition | Example |
|---------|---------|------------| ------------|
| cat |  | The cat command outputs the contents of a specified file. For example, running the following inside the movies/ directory | Input ``` $ cat genres.txt ``` or ``` catmaction/batman.txt ``` <br/> Output ``` output all the text from genres.txt ``` |
| cp | Copies files or directories | Copies files or directories from source to the destination | Input ``` $ cp source.txt destination.txt ``` <br/> Output ```This will make a copy of source.txt and save it as destination.bak.``` |
| mv |  Move Files  | Moves files without making a copy  | Input ``` $ mv source.txt destination/ ``` <br/> Output ```The source.txt will move to the destination directory.``` |
| rm |  Remove Files  | Delete files and directories  | Input ``` $ rm file.txt```  |

### Note about cp
> - The destination can be a directory. ```cp the-office.txt slapstick```. >   - The above example will put an exact copy named the-office.txt in the slapstick/ directory.

> - To rename the file, include the name in the path of the second argument:
>   - ```cp the-office.txt comedy/the-office-us.txt```

> - To copy multiple files into a directory, use cp with a list of source files as the first arguments, and the destination directory as the last argument. ```cp file1.txt file2.txt my_directory/```


### Note about bak
 > “.bak“ file extension is commonly used to notate a file as a backup of a file with the same name.


### Note about rm
> "- r" (recursive) option is used to the delete a directory and all of its child directories. ```rm -r unwanted_directory```

## Wildcards

> - In addition to using exact filenames as arguments, we can use special characters like * to select groups of files. These special characters are called wildcards.

| Command | Meaning | Definition | Example |
|---------|---------|------------| ------------|
| cp * | copy all files | Copy all files in the current working directory into another directory | ```cp * my_directory/``` |
| cp *.[filetype] | | Copy all the files that match the filetype that are in the current working directory | ```cp *.txt my_directory/``` |
| cp [prefix]*.[filetype] | | Copy all the files, in current working directory, that start with the prefix and match the filetype | ```cp w*.txt my_directory/``` |
