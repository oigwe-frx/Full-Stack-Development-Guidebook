# How the Internet works


## Overview of Origin
> - In 1969, the United States Department of Defense funded the creation of ARPANET, a precursor network to the Internet.
> - ARPANET stands for Advanced Research Projects Agency Network.
> - ARPANET connected the supercomputing centers run by government agencies and universities.

> - ___Purpose:___ connect their individual networks for large-scale information transfer.
> - ___Problem:___ However, many of them followed different standards and technical implementations.
> - ___Solution:___ In the 1970s, the transmission control protocol and internet protocol, otherwise known as TCP/IP, was created to provide standards around the transfer of data that would allow these early networks to communicate with each other.
  > - TCP/IP was researched and specified throughout the 1970s and adopted in the early 1980s. As different networks adopted TCP/IP, the interconnected global network of networks that is today known as the Internet was formed.
  



## Internet vs Web
> - ___Internet:___ the actual network of connected computing devices. Although the internet was around in the 1980s, there was no intuitive way for most people to browse the internet. The internet just sent messages produced by one computer and presented them to another computer.

> - ___Web:___ In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web. 
 > - The world wide web is a collection of interlinked websites and other web resources.
 >  - The world wide web, in combination with the rise of web browsers in the 1990s, introduced a user-friendly interface that enabled users to browse multimedia content and interact with other users.

## What is a Server
> - Let's look at the client-server model.
> - In this model, the client refers to the user’s device or program that is making a **request for data**.
 > A client can be a browser or application running on a user’s laptop, smartphone, or tablet.
 > The server is the device or program in that network that waits for incoming requests and sends back data (** a response**).
  > This might be an in-house server, a rented server at a data center, or cloud server.

### Server Responses - Status/Error Codes -  Why They Matter
 > When a server responds to a client, the server specifies a status code as a part of the response.
 > Status codes indicate whether or not the HTTP request was successfully completed and if there was an error, they contain some information about the type of error that happened.
 > The status code helps the browser know how to handle the data that was sent back with the response.
 > <br/>
 > | Status Code | Meaning | More Info |
 > | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
 > | Codes: 100 – 199 | Informational responses | [100s](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#information_responses) |
 > | Codes: 200 – 299 | Successful responses | [200s](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#successful_responses) |
 > | Codes: 300 – 399 | Redirection messages  | [300s](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#redirection_messages) |
 > | Codes: 400 – 499 | Client error responses  | [400s](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#client_error_responses) |
 > | Codes: 500 – 599 | Client error responses  | [500s](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#server_error_responses) |

### How Do Browsers Work
> Every time we load a webpage, our device sends a request for each file that makes up that page. So even when we’re just loading one webpage, that page can make multiple requests in order to retrieve different pieces of content, like images.
> 1. When a user types in a URL and presses enter, the server processes the request and sends the HTML file back to the client. HTML files hold the content of a website and they also contain links for any additional assets or code that are needed to display the site properly.
> 2. The browser will begin to search for elements in the HTML file and it will start to make additional HTTP requests for any other external resources used by the HTML file. This often includes:
> 3. One or more CSS stylesheets. CSS stands for cascading style sheets; CSS creates the style and layout of a web page. The browser will request the CSS stylesheet, and when the server sends it back, the browser analyzes the CSS and starts applying the visual styles to the content of the site.
> 4. The request-response cycle also sends website assets, like images and videos, from the server to the browser. If these files are large, there might even be a noticeable delay before they are rendered by the browser.
> 5. One or more JavaScript files. JavaScript makes the webpage interactive. This programming language functions as the “behavior” of the web page. A webpage that does not use JavaScript is known as a static webpage.
> 6. In most modern browsers, these additional requests are made in parallel. This means that these requests are initiated at the same time, and the browser does not wait to receive one resource before requesting the next resource.
> 7. All of the resources are typically displayed as soon as possible. The HTML will be displayed even if some of the other assets have not been received by the browser.

### Web 2.0

> #### Web 1.0
 > - The earliest static websites were composed of text, images, and links, with very little interactivity beyond browsing from one page to another.
 > - These websites are called ___static___, which means lacking in movement because they do not change based on user behavior.
 > - As internet connection speeds and web technologies progressed, more complex interactions became possible on the web.

>  ### Web 2.0
 > - A collection of advances in the early 2000s created a cluster of web applications that are often called “Web 2.0”.
 >  - In comparison to early static websites, ___Web 2.0 applications___ are often defined by:
  >  -  Providing a ___dynamic___ user experience by offering content that responds to user input without forcing the page to reload.

> - In the early web, user input would typically take the user to a new page — and they would have to wait for the new page to load.
  > -  In Web 2.0, websites could just update selected regions of the page, avoiding the interruption caused by reloading.

>  -  There were important technical advances that enabled each of these advances in the user interface of the internet. For example:
    >  - jQuery was the first JavaScript framework that could fetch data while the web page is running.
    >  - The rise of web frameworks that connected to databases, like Spring, Django, and Ruby on Rails, enabled user-generated content to effectively be created, stored, and displayed.
